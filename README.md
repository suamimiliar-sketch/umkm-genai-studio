# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1slRdn4gGFurPlfisriXc2ERHLR-jSLTZ

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
* A [Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/) for text and image generation

The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and leverages import maps to load React, the Gemini SDK and Lucide icons directly from CDN.  No bundler is required in production, but local development benefits from installing dependencies.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Although the app loads most runtime dependencies from a CDN at build time, Vite and TypeScript require dev‑dependencies (listed in `package.json`) to be installed locally.  If you encounter network restrictions, you can omit this step and still run in AI Studio, but local preview will not be available.

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create or edit the `.env.local` file at the project root.  It should define:

* `GEMINI_API_KEY` – your Gemini API key.  This key is used by `services/geminiService.ts` to call the Gemini 2.5 Flash model and the Imagen 3 image generator.
* `VITE_BACKEND_URL` – (optional) the base URL of your backend that returns a Midtrans Snap token.  When set, the payment service will send a POST request to `${VITE_BACKEND_URL}/create-transaction` with the product name and amount.  The backend should create a transaction via Midtrans and return a JSON response containing a `token` field.  If left empty, the application will fall back to a simulated payment flow using a confirmation dialog.

Example `.env.local`:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.example.com
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite in development mode.  Visit the printed local URL (usually http://localhost:5173) to interact with the app.  When using the simulated payment flow, clicking **Pay Rp 7 500** will display a confirmation modal and immediately return to the app.  When a real backend URL is provided, a payment popup from Midtrans Snap will open.

## Deploying

The project is optimized for running within [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/studio), which hosts your code in an iframe.  You can upload this repository’s zip directly to AI Studio Build.  Ensure that external API keys and backend URLs are stored in `.env.local` and not checked into version control.

When deploying outside AI Studio, host the static files generated by `vite build`.  To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The resulting files in `dist/` can be served by any static hosting provider.  If your deployment uses a real payment backend, make sure that Midtrans’s Snap.js script is allowed to run and that the `data-client-key` attribute in `index.html` is set to your Midtrans client key.
